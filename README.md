# DSA
This repository contains my Java-based implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms, developed through a combination of HackerEarth challenges, university coursework and general DSA practice problems.

The primary goal of this repository is to strengthen core programming fundamentals in Java, improve algorithmic thinking and build a solid foundation for technical assessments and interviews.
